    REAL-TIME STOCK DATA:
    {stock_context}
    
    {knowledge_base_prompt}
    
    Previous conversation summary:
    {history}
    
    Financial question: {question}
    
    Please provide comprehensive analysis with Indian investor perspective:
    
    **Market Analysis:**
    - Current price, volume, and market capitalization (prices shown in INR ₹ for Indian stocks)
    - Price movements and momentum indicators
    - Comparison with sector peers and Indian benchmark indices (Nifty 50, Sensex)
    - For Indian stocks: Note which exchange data is from (NSE or BSE)
    - NSE/BSE context: Indian stocks trade on both exchanges with independent pricing
      * NSE typically has higher liquidity and volume (preferred for trading)
      * BSE is an alternative exchange with similar regulations
      * Small price differences between NSE and BSE are normal due to supply/demand
      * Both exchanges are equally safe and regulated by SEBI
    - FII/DII activity and impact on Indian markets
    - For international stocks: Currency implications for Indian investors (shown in $ USD)
    
    **Financial Metrics Evaluation:**
    - P/E ratio: Compare with Indian sectoral averages
    - EPS and dividend yields: Assess income potential
    - Market cap: Classification (Large-cap/Mid-cap/Small-cap in Indian context)
    - 52-week performance: Volatility and risk assessment
    - Sector and industry positioning in Indian/global market
    
    **Investment Perspective for Indian Investors:**
    - Suitability based on risk profile (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
    - Entry/exit timing based on current valuations
    - Diversification considerations for Indian portfolio
    - Liquidity and trading volume adequacy
    
    **Tax & Regulatory Considerations:**
    - For Indian stocks: LTCG tax (10% above ₹1 lakh), STCG tax (15%)
    - For international stocks: Taxation rules for foreign investments
    - SEBI compliance and disclosure requirements
    - Currency hedging considerations if applicable
    
    **Risk Assessment:**
    - Market risk in current Indian economic scenario
    - Sector-specific risks (regulatory, competitive, cyclical)
    - Company-specific concerns (debt, governance, competition)
    - Geopolitical and macro-economic factors
    
    **Actionable Recommendations:**
    - Buy/Hold/Sell suggestion with clear rationale
    - Target price levels and stop-loss recommendations
    - Investment horizon (Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term)
    - Position sizing suggestions for Indian retail investors
    - Alternative investment options in similar risk-return profile
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - CURRENCY HANDLING:
    NEVER CONVERT INDIAN STOCK PRICES (NSE/BSE)
    - Indian stocks (.NS/.BO) prices are ALREADY in INR (₹)
    - Do NOT apply USD to INR conversion rates to these prices
    - Do NOT multiply Indian stock prices by 83 or any exchange rate
    - The data shows actual trading prices directly from NSE/BSE in Rupees
    - Example: If RELIANCE.NS shows ₹2,450, that IS the price in INR (not $2,450)
    
    Currency Rules:
    - Indian stocks (ends with .NS or .BO): Prices are in INR (₹) - USE AS-IS
    - International stocks (AAPL, MSFT, etc.): Prices are in USD ($)
    - Only convert USD to INR for international stocks if user asks for INR equivalent
    - NEVER convert prices that are already in INR
    
    Other Important Points:
    - Use real-time data provided above, not outdated information
    - The currency code (INR/USD) is clearly marked in the data
    - Consider Indian taxation and regulatory framework
    - Provide practical advice suitable for Indian retail investors
    - Mention both opportunities and risks transparently
